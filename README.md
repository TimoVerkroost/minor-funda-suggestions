## Build / Install and start project 

### Clone this repo

```
  git clone https://github.com/TimoVerkroost/minor-performance-matters-funda
  cd minor-performance-matters-funda
```

### Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Initialize .env file with your API key
Because we are working with a secret API key we have to hide it in an .env file, after you cloned the repo create in your root a file named .env after this fill in the example code below and change the API key.
```
FUNDA_KEY=ThisIsThePlaceWhereYourApiKeyShouldBe1337
```

### Build CSS and JS
This will build the minified and cleaned CSS and JavaScript files.
```
npm run build
```

### Start server
```
npm start
```

## Optimalisations

### With help of node modules
* Gzip compressed the website with [`compression`](https://github.com/expressjs/compression).
* Save and use form data with [`body-parser`](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser).
* API calls server-side with [`request`](https://github.com/request/request).
* Combine and compress JS with [`browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and [`esmangle`](https://github.com/estools/esmangle).
* Compress CSS with [`uglifycss`](https://github.com/fmarcia/UglifyCSS).
* Lazy load images with [`lazysizes`](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).
* Async font loading with [`fontfaceobserver`](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver).

### External tools and code refactor
* Client side JS are only enchantments for better UX.
  * LocalStorage to store the user data so he/she doesn't have to fill it in twice.
  * When in offline modes the external Funda images won't load they will be replace with blurred dummy images.
  * Lazy loaded images.
  * Async loading fonts.
* Critical CSS loaded before stylesheet.
* Caching used.
* Picture element to show right image on right size of screen.
* Optimized the SVG images with [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac).
* Font subsetting to load only the needed characters with [Fontie](https://fontie.pixelsvsbytes.com/webfont-generator).
* Async loading CSS with rel="preload" and added fallback with [loadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS/).
* ServiceWorker added to cache pages.

## To do
* [ ] Use promises for API calls in Expressjs
* [ ] Database to save "saved" houses so we don't have to do a request every time the page (re)loads.
  * [ ] Login to manage saved houses.
* [ ] Saved houses images offline available.
